Traffic Lights:
- currentStatus 		(red, orange, green, green_blinking, red_and_orange)
- getStatus() 			(IPC to traffic light control, polling)
- changeLight() 		(after receiving the new status, the lights should change accordingly)

Car:
- type 				(car, trucks)
- weight 			(depending on type)
- power 			(depending on type)
- max. speed 			(depending on type)
- current speed 		(the current speed is depending on the car in front of him and the distance to its)
- streetPart 			(the car should know on which streetpart it is)
- lookForward() 		(look forward a certain distance to see if an intersection of another car occurs)
- accelerate() 			(can be negative too)
- turnOnIntersection() 		(randomly decide which direction the car should move, this should happen a view meters before the intersection so the car can queue on the right lane)
- checkOnIntersection() 	(used to check if a car comes from both sides on a non-traffic-light controled intersection)
- changeRoadSide() 		(check if car is besides and then change lane, depending on how fast the car is going and how many space is between the 2 cars on the other lanes)

Intersection:
- countTrafficLights		(this may be the same number as "countExits" but there can be intersections where no traffic lights are)
- countExits			(could be used for the cars to randomly select an intersection exit)

Road:
- type 				(curve, straight)
- rotation			(could be helpfull to turn the car accordingly)

Traffic Light Simulation:
- countTrafficLights		(dunno)
- changeLights 			(changes the light of every traffic light, depending on a certain time intervall)

Simulation:
- List of cars/trucks 		(to have a maximum amount of them, so the user may change this variable)
- List of street, intersection 	(dunno)
- generateCar/Truck() 		(this should generate cars if the max. number of cars is not reached. also should randomly generate trucks by a given percentage)
- deleteCar() 			(this is called when a car/truck reaches a certain field, where the cars disappear so new ones can be generated)
